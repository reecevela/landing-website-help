# Landing Website:

- This project is an overview and a general representation of everything I've learned throughout the curriculum of The Odin Project. It's been a great journey so far and these projects are really important tasks that help one become a great programmer. 

- The site contains elements that we've covered in the 'Fundamentals' alongside the popular layout model, Flexbox. The project has been somewhat challenging, we all know Flexbox is a little confusing for beginners at first but these challenges are a great cause, it forced me to find solutions to problems and that's one valuable skill that a programmer should have.
